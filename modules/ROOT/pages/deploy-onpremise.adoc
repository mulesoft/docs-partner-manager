= On-Premises Deployment

Deploying message flows on-premises involves installing and configuring Mule runtime engine (Mule) on-premises, registering Mule in the appropriate environment in Anypoint Runtime Manager, and creating a server group for the servers that you create.

To deploy to an on-premises Mule instance that uses a firewall and load balancer, work with your organizationâ€™s hosting or network security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS or name of the instance host. Replace the `{runtime_host}` value in the URL with the specific value for your organization.

Each Partner Manager runtime application is deployed as an HTTP listener that listens on ports starting from port 10090. Leave ports 10090 through to 10100 open from a network standpoint before you deploy message flows on-premises.


To set up the on-premises environment:

. In the appropriate environment within your Anypoint Platform account, create a server group in the Runtime agent and name it `B2BServerGroup`. All Mule B2B-processing apps are deployed to this server group.
+
When you create the server group:

* Name `B2BServerGroup` exactly as shown, because the server group name is case-sensitive.
* Configure `B2BServerGroup` with a single Mule runtime server because Partner Manager does not support multiple runtime instances within the group.

+
See the Runtime Manager documentation xref:runtime-manager::server-group-create.adoc[Create a Server Group (Hybrid)] for the steps to create a server group.
+
. xref:mule-runtime::runtime-installation-task.adoc[Download and Install Mule]. 
+
Refer to the release notes to see what version of Mule Partner Manager supports. 
+
. After you install Mule, navigate to the `wrapper.conf` file, which is located in `$MULE_HOME/conf/`.
. In the `wrapper.conf` file, add the required parameters and adjust the memory and heap size configuration values for your environment.

If you are unsure about the Mule capacity you need to manage your B2B transactions, contact your MuleSoft account representative for assistance.
