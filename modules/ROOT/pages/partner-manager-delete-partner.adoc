= Delete a Partner

If you are no longer trading with a partner, you can delete it.

When you delete a partner, it is removed from the *Partners* page. Also, all of the partner's data is deleted, except for information about partner-related activities that occurred before the deletion.

== Prerequisites for On-Premise Installations

To delete a partner in an on-premises installation, ensure that your on-premises Mule instances, the servers hosting them, and the server group in Anypoint Runtime Manager named `B2BserverGroup` are active and running.

To obtain these statuses, contact your B2B System Administrator.
You check the status of the host servers in Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager.

== Steps

To delete a partner:

. In Anypoint Partner Manager, select *Partners* in the navigation menu.
. Select the partner to delete and click *Delete*.
. Confirm the deletion.

After you delete a partner, you can reuse the partner name.
