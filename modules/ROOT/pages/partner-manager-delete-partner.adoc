= Deleting Partners

If you are no longer trading with a partner, you can delete the partner.

When you delete a partner, the partner is removed from the Partner Manager's *Partners* page. All of the partner's data is deleted, except for partner activities that occurred before the partner was deleted.

To delete a partner:

. From your Anypoint Partner Manager sandbox or production environment, select *Partners* from the navigation menu.
. Select the partner to delete and click *Delete*.
. In the confirmation dialog, confirm the deletion.

After you delete a partner, you can reuse the partner name.
