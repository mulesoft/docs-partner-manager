= Delete a Partner

If you are no longer trading with a partner, you can delete the partner.

When you delete a partner, the partner is removed from the Partner Manager's *Partners* page. All of the partner's data is deleted, except for partner-related activities that occurred before the deletion.

== Prerequisites
--
To delete a partner in an on-premises installation, contact your B2B System Administrator to ensure that your on-premises Mule instances, the servers hosting them, and the server group in Anypoint Runtime Manager called `B2BserverGroup` are active and running.

You can check the status of the server in Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager.

== Steps

To delete a partner:

. In Anypoint Partner Manager, select *Partners* in the navigation menu.
. Select the partner to delete and click *Delete*.
. Confirm the deletion.

After you delete a partner, you can reuse the partner name.
