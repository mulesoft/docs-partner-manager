Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) enables you to create, populate and edit a _lookup table_.  A lookup table is a table that facilitates transaction processing by associating values. For example, this page shows how to create a lookup table that associates internal partner product codes with customer product codes.

. If you want to create a lookup table or edit the name, fields or keys for an existing table, go to <<Administer a Lookup Table>>.
The fields you add will become the columns of the table.
+
If you want to enter data for a table, go to <<Working with Lookup Table Data>>.
The data that you add for each field will populate the rows of the field.
