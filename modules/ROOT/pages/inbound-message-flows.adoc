= Inbound Message Flows

An inbound message flow does the following:

. Receives application messages from your partner, either directly or through a third-party connection
. Transforms the messages to the format used by your back-end applications
. Forwards the messages to those applications

The following diagram shows the components of an inbound message flow:
