= Tracking Individual Messages

The message view in Anypoint Partner Manager provides visibility into individual transactions within a transmission. Use the message view to monitor the messages exchanged between partner and suppliers, view the message payload, and see how individual messages are processed and routed.

The message view has one record for each transaction. For example, if an incoming transmission contains 30 transactions, the message view has 30 corresponding records.

A message record contains the following information:

* Business key and other custom attributes that are included in the message type definition
* Pre-translated and post-translated payloads

Partner Manager does not create message view records when:

* An inbound transaction fails during validation, resulting in a complete rejection of the transaction.
* An inbound transaction fails due to AS2 security issues.
* An outbound transaction fails when translating the source payload to a different format.
* An outbound transaction fails when writing X12 or EDIFACT data.

To track transmissions instead of individual messages, see xref:activity-tracking.adoc[Tracking Transmissions].
