= Create a Map For XML or JSON to Outbound EDI X12

Create a template project in Anypoint Studio to import a template that creates a DataWeave map to transform application formats such as XML and JSON to outbound EDI X12 transactions, then test the map locally.

== Create a New Project From a Template

Create a template project in Anypoint Studio and import a DataWeave map template that maps application messages to outbound EDI X12 transactions:

. Launch Anypoint Studio.
. From the Anypoint Studio *File* menu, select *New > Project from Template*.
. Log in to Anypoint Exchange with your Anypoint Platform credentials.
. Search for `X12`.
. Click `Template to map application messages to outbound EDI X12 transactions`.
. Click *Open* to create a new project in your Studio workspace that is preloaded with the template. 

You can also download the template to map inbound EDI X12 transactions to the application format https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/template-b2b-edi-outbound-x12-map[from Exchange].

== Set the Source Message Type

To set the source JSON or XML message type for the map:

. Copy the schema file of your target application message type into the `<Project-name>/src/main/resources` folder in the template project.
. From the *Mule Palette* view, click *Transform Message* and drag it on to the Studio canvas.
. Select the *Transform Message* component and in the input section, next to *Payload*, click *Define metadata*:

+
. Click *Add*.
. In *Type id*, enter a new message type ID, for example, `enterprise-outbound-purchase-order`.
. Click *Create type*.
. In the *Select metadata type* dialog window, from the *Type* drop-down menu, select *JSON* or *XML*. 
. Browse to the location of the JSON or XML schema file you imported in Step 1 and click *Select*.

== Set the Target X12 Message Type

The template has the X12 configuration for the below X12 transaction set:

* Version +
`4010`
* Transaction Set + 
`850 (Purchase order)`

Follow these steps to set the target X12 message type:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the Studio canvas in `global-configs.xml`.
. From *Global Configuration Elements*, select *X12 EDO Config* and click *Edit*.
. In *Name*, change the name of the configuration.
. In the *Schema definitions*, select *Edit inline*. 
. Select the value */x12/004010/850.esl* and click the edit icon:
+

+
. Change the schema value to the version and transaction set you want to map from, for example, set the value to `/x12/004010/204.esl`, if you want to map to a 4010-204 Load tender transaction. +
You now see your application message structure (JSON or XML) on the input pane in the left, and the X12 transaction set structure on the output pane in the right.
. Click *Finish*, then click *OK*. +
You can now begin mapping from the input to the output.

== Test the Map Locally

Follow these steps to test the map locally in Anypoint Studio: 

. In *Package Explorer*, right-click on the project, and click *Run > Run as Mule application*.
. Use a REST client to post a JSON or an XML payload to the URL `+http://localhost:8081/x12/out+`. +
The application returns the translated EDI X12 transaction.
. Copy the DataWeave map from `src/main/resources/x12/OUT-application-message-to-X12-version-transaction-partner.dwl` and rename it to something meaningful, for example, `OUT-SAP-purchaseorder-XML-to-X12-4010-850-MythicalSupplier.dwl`.

Later, when you create and configure an outbound message flow, you can import the `.dwl` file to the *Map* section of outbound message flow.
