= Creating a Translation Map For XML or JSON to Outbound X12

Create a template project in Anypoint Studio to import a template that creates a DataWeave map to transform application formats such as XML and JSON to outbound EDI X12 transactions, then test the map locally.

== Create a New Project From a Template

Create a template project in Anypoint Studio and import a DataWeave map template that maps application messages to outbound X12 transactions:

. Launch Anypoint Studio.
. From the Anypoint Studio *File* menu, select *New > Project from Template*.
. Log in to Anypoint Exchange with your Anypoint Platform credentials.
. Search for `X12`.
. Click `Template to map application messages to outbound X12 transactions`.
. Click *Open* to create a new project in your Studio workspace that is preloaded with the template.

You can also download the template to map inbound X12 transactions to the application format https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/template-b2b-edi-outbound-x12-map[from Exchange].

== Set the Source Message Type

To set the source JSON or XML message type for the map:

. Copy the schema file of your target application message type into the `<Project-name>/src/main/resources` folder in the template project.
. From the *Mule Palette* view, click *Transform Message* and drag it on to the Studio canvas.
. Select the *Transform Message* component and in the input section, next to *Payload*, click *Define metadata*:

+
. Click *Add*.
. In *Type id*, enter a new message type ID, for example, `enterprise-outbound-purchase-order`.
. Click *Create type*.
. In the *Select metadata type* dialog window, from the *Type* drop-down menu, select *JSON* or *XML*.
. Browse to the location of the JSON or XML schema file you imported in Step 1 and click *Select*.

== Set the Target X12 Message Type

The template has the X12 configuration for the following X12 transaction set:

* Version +
`4010`
* Transaction Set +
`850 (Purchase order)`

Follow these steps to set the target X12 message type:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the Studio canvas in `global-configs.xml`.
. From *Global Configuration Elements*, select *X12 EDI Config* and click *Edit*.
. In *Name*, change the name of the configuration.
. In the *Schema definitions*, select *Edit inline*.
. Select the value */x12/004010/850.esl* and click the edit icon:
+

+
. Change the schema value to the version and transaction set you want to map from, for example, set the value to `/x12/004010/204.esl`, if you want to map to a 4010-204 Load tender transaction.
+
The application message structure (JSON or XML) displays in the input pane of the Transform Message graphical view, and the X12 transaction set structure displays in the output pane of this view.
. Click *Finish*, then click *OK*. +
You can now begin mapping from the input to the output.

== Test the Map Locally

Follow these steps to test the map locally in Anypoint Studio:

. In *Package Explorer*, right-click on the project, and click *Run > Run as Mule application*.
. Use a REST client to post a JSON or an XML payload to the URL `+http://localhost:8081/x12/out+`. +
The application returns the transformed X12 transaction.
. Copy the DataWeave map from `src/main/resources/x12/OUT-application-message-to-X12-version-transaction-partner.dwl` and rename it to something meaningful, for example, `OUT-SAP-purchaseorder-XML-to-X12-4010-850-MythicalSupplier.dwl`.

Later, when you create and configure outbound message flows, you can import the `.dwl` file to the *Map* section of outbound message flow.
