= FTP Receive Endpoint Settings

FTP receive endpoints determine where to receive B2B messages transmitted over FTP. There are two types of FTP endpoints:

* Receive from Partners
+
Source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B messages from partners either directly or via third-party connections.
+
A host, partner, or third-party connection can own FTP Receive from Partners endpoints.
+
* Source at Host
+
Source endpoint in an outbound message flow that receives messages from the backend applications.
+
Only a host can own FTP Source at Host endpoints.

Create FTP receive endpoints by configuring these settings on the *<host>* or *Partner* pages. You can also create these endpoints when you configure an outbound message flow:
