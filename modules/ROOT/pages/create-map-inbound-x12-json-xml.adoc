= Create a Translation Map For Inbound X12 to JSON or XML

Create a template project in Anypoint Studio to import a template to map inbound EDI X12 transactions to an application message format, such as JSON or XML, then test the map locally.

== Create a New Project From a Template

Create a template project in Studio and import a DataWeave map template that maps inbound X12 transactions to an application format:

. Launch Studio.
. From the *File* menu, select *New > Project from Template*.
. Log in to Anypoint Exchange with your Anypoint Platform credentials
. Search for `X12`.
. Click the template named `Template to map inbound X12 transactions to application message format`.
. Click *Open*, to create a new project in your Studio workspace that is preloaded with the template.

You can also download the template to map inbound X12 transactions to the application format https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/template-b2b-edi-inbound-x12-map[from Exchange].

== Set the Source X12 Message Type

The template to map X12 transactions to an application message format contains the following X12 transaction set:

* Version +
`4010`
* Transaction Set +
`850 (Purchase order)`

Follow these steps to set the source X12 message type for the map:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the Studio canvas in `global-configs.xml`.
. From *Global Configuration Elements*, select *X12 EDI Inbound* and click *Edit*.
. In *Name*, change the name of the configuration to something meaningful.
. In *Schema definitions*, select *Edit inline*.
. Select the value */x12/004010/850.esl* and click the edit icon.
. Change the schema value to the version and transaction set you want to map from. +
For example, set *Value* to `/x12/004010/204.esl`, if you want to map to a `4010-204 Load tender` transaction.

== Set the Target JSON or XML Message Type

Set the target JSON or XML message type to transform inbound X12 messages to your application message formats, such as XML or JSON:

. Copy the schema file of your target application message type into the `<Project-name>/src/main/resources` folder in the template project.
. From the *Mule Palette* view, click the *Transform Message* component and drag it on to the Studio canvas.
. Select the *Transform Message* component and in the output section, next to *Payload*, click *Define metadata*.

+
. Click *Add*.
. In *Type id*, enter a new message type ID, for example `enterprise-inbound-purchase-order`.
. Click *Create type*.
. From the *Type* drop-down menu in *Select metadata type*, select *JSON* or *XML*.
. Browse to the location of the JSON or XML schema file you imported in Step 1 and click *Select*. +
The new X12 transaction set structure displays in the input pane on the left, and your application message structure (JSON or XML) displays in the output pane on the right. +
You can now begin mapping from the input to the output.

== Test the Map Locally

Follow these steps to test the translation map locally in Anypoint Studio:

. In *Package Explorer*, right-click on the template project, and select *Run > Run as Mule application*.
. Use a REST client to post an EDI message payload to the URL `+http://localhost:8081/x12/in+`. +
The application returns the transformed JSON or XML.
. After you verify that the map works correctly, copy the DataWeave map from `src/main/resources/x12/IN-X12-version-transaction-to-applicationmessage.dwl` and rename it to something meaningful, such as `IN-X12-4010-850-to-SAP-purchaseorder.dwl`.

Later, when you create and configure inbound message flows, you can import the `dwl` file to the *Map* section of inbound message flow.
