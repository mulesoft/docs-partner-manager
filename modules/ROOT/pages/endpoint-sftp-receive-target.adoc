= SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings

SFTP receive endpoints configure where to receive B2B messages transmitted over SFTP. There are two types of SFTP receive endpoints:

* Receive from Partners
+
Source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B messages from partners either directly or via third-party connections.
+
A host, partner, or third-party connection can own SFTP Receive from Partners endpoints.
+
* Source at Host
+
Source endpoint in an outbound message flow that receives messages from the backend applications.
+
Only a host can own SFTP Source at Host endpoints.

Create SFTP receive endpoints by configuring these settings on the *<host>* or *Partner* page:
