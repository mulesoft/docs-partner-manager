After your new or or reconfigured endpoint is saved, you cannot subsequently retrieve or modify the password.

The backend applications that send JSON or XML payloads to the HTTP receive endpoint must pass the credentials in the HTTP request header.

|API Key
a|The API key for the HTTP listener.

After selecting *API Key* in the *Authentication type* picklist, specify the HTTP header name and API key to protect the HTTP listener. After your new or reconfigured endpoint is saved, you cannot subsequently retreive or modify the API key.

== HTTP or HTTPS URL

The value in the URL field is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow to CloudHub that uses this endpoint. You can view this URL by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.

If you are deploying to on-premises Mule instance with a firewall and load balancer, work with your hosting or network security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS or name of the host where the Mule server is running, and replace `{runtime_host}` in the URL with the DNS name of your host. For example, if your DNS host name is `b2b.mycompany.com`, the receiver URL is `+https://b2b.mycompany.com/base-path/+`.
