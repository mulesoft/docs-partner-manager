= HTTP and HTTPS Receive Endpoint Settings

HTTP and HTTPS receive endpoints configure where to receive B2B messages transmitted over HTTP or HTTPS, respectively. There are two type of HTTP and HTTPS endpoints:

* Receive from Partners
+
Source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives inbound B2B messages from partners either directly or via third-party connections.
+
A host, partner, or third-party connection can own HTTP and HTTPS Receive from Partners endpoints.
+
* Source at Host
+
Source endpoint in an outbound message flow that receives application messages from the backend applications
+
Only a host can own HTTP or HTTPS Source at Host endpoints.

IMPORTANT: Each HTTP and HTTPS receive endpoint configuration gets deployed as an individual Mule application in the runtime. To minimize the number of vCores needed to run Anypoint Partner Manager, use an existing HTTP or HTTPS receive endpoint configuration across multiple message flows.

Create HTTP and HTTPS receive endpoints by configuring these settings on the *<host>* page:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description |Required
|Endpoint Name
|Automatically generated name used to identify the endpoint, which you can modify manually.
|x

| Owner
a| Host, partner, or third-party connection that owns the endpoint.
| x

| Usage
|Endpoint function (`Receive from partners` or `Source at host`).
|x

| Protocol
| Protocol that the endpoint supports (`HTTP` or `HTTPS`).
| x

| Description
| User-supplied value that describes the purpose of the endpoint.
|

| Private port (when deploying to VPC)
a|
Applies when using Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) with CloudHub deployments:

* When enabled, the AS2 receive endpoint application deploys to the private port `8092` in your xref:runtime-manager::virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Anypoint VPC]. You can manage the access control to the endpoint via the Anypoint VPC and dedicated load balancer settings.
+
* When disabled, the AS2 receive endpoint application deploys to the public port `8082` by default. 
+
You can access the endpoint URL directly over the internet.
|

| Manage with API manager
a| Enable this setting to manage the endpoint with API Manager. To use this functionality, you must create an HTTP API in API Manager in the same environment and organization as the endpoint.

When you create this API in API Manager:

* Select `HTTP API` as the asset type.
* Leave the defaults on the *Endpoint configuration* screen.
* Copy the API instance ID and paste it into the *API Auto discovery id* field in the Partner Manager *New endpoint: Receive from Partners* window.

NOTE: Using this feature requires an API Manager license.
|

|HTTPS
a|Applies to CloudHub deployments.

Indicates whether Partner Manager deploys this endpoint as an HTTPS or HTTP listener:

* If enabled (default), Partner Manager deploys this endpoint as an HTTPS listener.
* If disabled, Partner Manager deploys this endpoint as an HTTP listener.

When deploying to Anypoint Runtime Fabric, Partner Manager always deploys this endpoint as an HTTP listener. With this type of deployment, you must configure an Ingress controller to provide external consumers with an HTTPS endpoint. For more information, see xref:runtime-fabric::custom-ingress-configuration.adoc[Configuring Ingress for Runtime Fabric].
|x

|URL
a|HTTP or HTTPS address where you receive outbound source messages from backend applications or inbound B2B messages from your partners. Partner Manager automatically generates this ID after the first message flow that uses the endpoint is deployed.
|x

|Response timeout (in milliseconds)
|Response timeout period in milliseconds. The default is `15000`.
|x

|Authentication type
a|Authentication method used to protect the HTTP or HTTPS endpoint. This field is disabled when you manage the endpoint with API Manager.

Valid values are:

* None
+
No authentication
+
* <<api-key,API key>>
* <<basic,Basic>>

== Next Step

After you create an HTTP or HTTPS receive endpoint, you can deploy it, as described in xref:deploying-receive-endpoints.adoc[Deploying AS2, HTTP, and HTTPS Receive Endpoints].
