= AS2 Receive Endpoint Settings

AS2 receive endpoint settings determine where to receive B2B messages received over AS2.

An AS2 Receive from Partners endpoint (the only type of AS2 receive endpoint) acts as the source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B messages from partners either directly or via third-party connections.
One AS2 endpoint can receive data from multiple partners, multiple third-party connections, or both.

Only a host can own AS2 Receive from Partners endpoints.

IMPORTANT: Each AS2 receive endpoint configuration gets deployed as an individual Mule application in the runtime. To minimize the number of vCores needed to run Anypoint Partner Manager, use an existing AS2 receive endpoint configuration across multiple message flows.

Create an AS2 Receive from Partners endpoint by configuring these settings on the *<host>* page:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Setting | Description | Required

|Owner
|Host that owns the endpoint.
|x

|Usage
|Endpoint function (`Receive from partners`).
| x

|Protocol
|Protocol that the endpoint supports (`AS2`).
|x

|Endpoint name
|Automatically generated name used to identify the endpoint, which you can modify manually.
|x

|Description
|User-supplied value that describes the purpose of the endpoint.
|

|Private port (when deploying to VPC)
a|
Applies when using Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) with CloudHub deployments:

* When enabled, the AS2 receive endpoint application deploys to the private port `8092` in your xref:runtime-manager::virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Anypoint VPC]. You can manage the access control to the endpoint via the Anypoint VPC and dedicated load balancer settings.
+
* When disabled, the AS2 receive endpoint application deploys to the public port `8082` by default. 
+
You can access the endpoint URL directly over the internet.
|
| HTTPS
a| Applies to CloudHub deployments.

Indicates whether Partner Manager deploys the AS2 receive endpoint as an HTTPS listener:

* If enabled (default), Partner Manager deploys the AS2 receive endpoint as an HTTPS listener.
* If disabled, Partner Manager deploys the AS2 receive endpoint as an HTTP listener.

When deploying to Anypoint Runtime Fabric, Partner Manager always deploys the AS2 receive endpoint as an HTTP listener. With this type of deployment, you must configure an Ingress controller to provide external consumers with an HTTPS endpoint. For more information, see xref:runtime-fabric::custom-ingress-configuration.adoc[Configuring Ingress for Runtime Fabric].
| x

| AS2 URL
| URL to the AS2 server (automatically generated).
| x

| Certificate (TLS Context)
| Applies if the *AS2 URL* field starts with `HTTPS:\\`. 
|

|Enforce security level
a|Indicates whether Partner Manager rejects incoming AS2 messages that aren't signed, encrypted, or both. When Partner Manager rejects a message, it returns a negative Message Disposition Notification (MDN) to the sender.

Allowed values:

* `Signed & Encrypted`
+
(Default) Rejects incoming messages that aren't both signed and encrypted.
* `Signed`
+
Rejects incoming messages that aren't signed.
* `Encrypted`
+
Rejects incoming messages that aren't encrypted.
* `None`
+
Accepts messages that aren't signed or encrypted.

When deploying an AS2 endpoint to CloudHub using the HTTP protocol, you cannot change the default value (`Signed & Encrypted`).
| x
|<Host> keystore
a|Host keystore file that stores your organization's public certificate and private key. Select an existing keystore file or create a new one.

To create a new keystore file:

. In the *<host> Keystore* field, click *Select*.
. Click *New*.
. Complete the fields on the *New certficate for <host> window*, as described in xref:manage-host-certificates.adoc[].
. Click *Create*.

== Next Step

After you create an AS2 receive endpoint, you can deploy it, as described in xref:deploying-receive-endpoints.adoc[Deploying AS2, HTTP, and HTTPS Receive Endpoints].
