= AS2 Receive Endpoint Settings

AS2 receive endpoint settings determine where to receive B2B messages received over AS2.

An AS2 Receive from Partners endpoint (the only type of AS2 receive endpoint) acts as the source endpoint in an inbound message flow that receives B2B messages from partners either directly or via third-party connections.
One AS2 endpoint can receive data from multiple partners, multiple third-party connections, or both.

Only a host can own AS2 Receive from Partners endpoints.

IMPORTANT: Each AS2 receive endpoint configuration gets deployed as an individual Mule application in the runtime. Consider reusing an existing AS2 receive endpoint configuration across message flows.

Create an AS2 Receive from Partners endpoint by configuring these settings on the *<host>* page:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Setting | Description | Required

|Protocol
|Protocol that the endpoint supports.
|x

|Owner
|Host that owns the endpoint.
|x

|Endpoint name
|Automatically generated name used to identify the endpoint, which you can modify manually.
|x

|Description
|User-supplied value that describes the purpose of the endpoint.
|

|Private port (when deploying to VPC)
a|
* When enabled, the AS2 receive endpoint application deploys to the private port `8092` in your xref:runtime-manager::virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Anypoint VPC]. You can manage the access control to the endpoint via the Anypoint VPC and dedicated load balancer settings.
* When disabled, the AS2 receive endpoint application deploys to the public port `8082` by default. You can access the endpoint URL directly over the internet.

{sp}
{sp}
This configuration applies only to Anypoint VPC deployments from Partner Manager.
|
| HTTPS
a| Indicates whether Partner Manager deploys the AS2 receive endpoint as an HTTPS listener service:

* If enabled (default), Partner Manager deploys the AS2 receive endpoint as an HTTPS listener service.
* If disabled, Partner Manager deploys the AS2 receive endpoint as an HTTP listener.

This field applies only when deploying to CloudHub. When deploying to on-premises Mule runtimes, Partner Manager always deploys the AS2 receive endpoint as an HTTP listener.

| x

|Enforce security level
a|Indicates whether Partner Manager rejects incoming AS2 messages that aren't signed, encrypted, or both. When Partner Manager rejects a message, it returns a negative Message Disposition Notification (MDN) to the sender.

Allowed values:

* Signed & Encrypted (default)
+
(Default) Rejects incoming messages that aren't both signed and encrypted.
* Signed
+
Rejects incoming messages that aren't signed.
* Encrypted
+
Rejects incoming messages that aren't encrypted.
* None
+
Accepts messages that aren't signed or encrypted.

When deploying an AS2 endpoint to CloudHub using the HTTP protocol, you cannot change the default value (`Signed & Encrypted`).
| x
|<Host> keystore
a|Host keystore file that stores your organization's public certificate and private key. To create a new keystore when creating an endpoint:

--
. Click *New*.
. Complete the fields on the *New keystore for <host> window*.
. Click *Upload Keystore*.
--

For more information about host keystores, see xref:manage-as2-host-keystores.adoc[Managing AS2 Host Keystores].

== Next Step

After you create an AS2 receive endpoint, you can deploy it, as described in xref:deploying-receive-endpoints.adoc[Deploying AS2, HTTP, and HTTPS Receive Endpoints].
