= Modifying Endpoints

Although endpoint settings don't often require changes, you might need to modify them under certain circumstances. For example:

* Customers move their data center, so you must change the IP address or host name.
* Customers update their credentials, so you must change the user credentials in the endpoint configuration.
* Customers change their file naming conventions and response timeout requirements, so you must change these configurations for the endpoint.
* The downstream API that receives translated inbound data moves from one region to another, so you must change the endpoint URL.

To modify an endpoint:

. Access the endpoint you want to modify from the endpoint owner's page (the *<host>*, *<partner>*, or third-party page, depending on the endpoint).
. Click *Edit*.
. Modify the desired settings. What you can modify depends on the endpoint protocol and usage, as described in the following sections:
* <<as2-receive>>
* <<as2-send>>
* <<ftp-receive>>
* <<ftp-send>>
* <<http-receive>>
* <<http-send>>
* <<https-receive>>
* <<https-send>>
. Click *Save* to save your changes.
. On the confirmation window that opens, select the *I understand the effects of these actions* checkbox and then click *Confirm*.
+
Partner Manager displays a *Deploy* button next to the modified endpoint.
+
. Click *Deploy* to keep the endpoint changes.
. On the confirmation window that opens, select the *I understand the effects of these actions* checkbox and then click *Confirm*.
+
Partner Manager redeploys the endpoint and all message flows that use the endpoint.
+
If required, Partner Manager also automatically deploys the Mule runtime applications that Partner Manager uses. The deployment of Mule runtime applications can take up to five minutes or longer to complete, depending on how many runtime applications are affected.
