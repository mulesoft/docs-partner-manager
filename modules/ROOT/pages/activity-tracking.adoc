= Tracking Transmissions

In Anypoint Partner Manager, one transmission can consist of one or more messages. Use the transmission view to monitor transmissions exchanged between partners and to view the transmission contents. At a high level, a transmission record contains the following information:

* Data payloads received from partners or sent to partners via a configured protocol such as AS2, HTTP, SFTP or FTP
* Message disposition notifications (MDNs), if the payload is exchanged with partners via AS2 protocol
functional acknowledgements

To track individual messages, see xref:activity-message-tracking.adoc[Tracking Individual Messages].

== Locate a Transmission

Select a transmission to view its details and view and download the message contents:

. In the navigation menu, select *Activity*.
. Select *Transmissions*.
. Search for the transmission.
. Optionally, filter the search results based on the following criteria:

* Partner name
