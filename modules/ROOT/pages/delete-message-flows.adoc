= Deleting Message Flows

You can delete message flows that no longer serve their purpose, for example, if your relationship with your partner changes. You can delete message flows from any environment.

Deleting a message flow automatically undeploys the flow. 

To delete a message flow:

. In the sidebar, select *Message Flows*.
. Select the message flow to delete and click *Delete* in the upper right of the screen.

Transmissions already sent by a message flow that is subsequently deleted remain recorded in the *Activity page*. Links to the stored payloads (such as the original B2B message), TA1 acknowledgments, the transformed payload, and so on, continue to work.
