= Message Types

Message types define the schematic structure of the transactions that are received or sent by Partner Manager. 

In Partner Manager, a message type can be used in one of the following contexts:

* Receive from partners
* Target at host
* Source at host
* Send to partners

Message types are always managed within the host profile page, regardless of whether they are used specifically for a single partner or across multiple trading partners. Message types are reusable across message flows for different trading partners.
