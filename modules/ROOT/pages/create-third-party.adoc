= Creating Third-Party Connections

Create a new third-party connection by using the *Partners* page to specify the connection's name, identifiers, connection-specific endpoints (if needed), and other settings.

Before you create your first third-party connection, make sure that you have xref:setup-payload-storage-API.adoc[configured your payload storage API] and that you obtain the following information:

* The connection name (usually the name of the company)
* One or more AS2 identifiers for the connection

To create a third-party connection:

. In Partner Manager, select *Partners* in the sidebar.
. Click *Create partner > 3rd party connection*.
. Enter the following information:
+

| Text string that uniquely identifies the connection
| *Type*
| Identifier type
| *Identifier Value*
| Either a value that uniquely identifies the connection within the EDI stream or the AS2 identifier (if the connection uses AS2)
|===
+
. Click *Create 3rd party connection*.

== Configure Additional Connection Settings

Add the following settings for the new third-party connection, either now or later on:

| Click *New* in the *Endpoints* section.

After you create a third-party connection and configure third-party-specific endpoints (if needed), you can set up message flows that use the connection.
