= Creating 3rd Party Connections

Create a new 3rd party connection by using the *Partners* page to specify the connection's name, identifiers, connection-specific endpoints (if needed), and other settings.

== Prerequisites

Before you create your first 3rd party connection, make sure that you have xref:setup-payload-storage-API.adoc[configured your payload storage API] and that you obtain the following information:

* The connection name (usually the name of the company)
* One or more AS2 identifiers for the connection

== Steps

After meeting the prerequisites to create a 3rd party connection:

. In Partner Manager, select *Partners* in the navigation menu.
. Click *Create partner > 3rd party connection*.
. Enter the following information:

|===
+
. Click *Create 3rd party connection*.

== Configure Additional Connection Settings

Add the following settings for the new 3rd party connection, either now or later on:

After you create a 3rd-party connection and configure 3rd-party-specific endpoints (if needed), you can set up message flows that use the connection.
