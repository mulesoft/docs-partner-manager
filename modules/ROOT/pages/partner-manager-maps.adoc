= Translation Maps

Partner Manager uses DataWeave maps to transform business transactions between your partner's message formats and your organizationâ€™s enterprise application message formats.

Use Anypoint Connector for X12 or Anypoint Connector for EDIFACT with DataWeave 2.0 to:

. Create EDI translation maps in Anypoint Studio.
. Import the maps to Partner Manager when you configure inbound and outbound message flows.

For examples of DataWeave maps on Exchange that transform data, see:

* https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/com.mulesoft.muleesb.modules/b2b-procure-to-pay-mappings/minor/1.0/[Implementing end to end B2B procure to pay workflow from the perspective of a seller]

After you import a map to Partner Manager, you can access source message attributes in that map. For information, see xref:access-source-message-attributes.adoc[Accessing Source Message Attributes].
