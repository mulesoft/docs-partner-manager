= EDI Translation Maps

Partner Manager uses DataWeave maps to transform business transactions between EDI message format (X12) and your organization’s enterprise application message formats, such as JSON and XML. 

Use Anypoint Connector for X12 and DataWeave 2.0 together to create EDI translation maps in Anypoint Studio and then import the maps to Partner Manager when you configure inbound and outbound message flows.
