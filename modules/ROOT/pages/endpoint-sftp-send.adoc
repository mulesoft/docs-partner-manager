= SFTP Send Endpoint Settings

SFTP send endpoint settings configure where to send B2B messages transmitted over SFTP. There are two types of SFTP send endpoints:

* Send to Partners
** Target endpoint in an outbound message flow through which transformed B2B messages are sent to partners, either directly or through third-party connections
** Acknowledgement endpoint in an inbound message flow

+
A host, partner, or third-party connection can own SFTP Send to Partners endpoints.

* Target at Host
+
Target endpoint in an inbound message flow through which transformed JSON and XML messages are sent to the backend applications.
+
Only a host can own SFTP Target at Host endpoints.

Create SFTP send endpoints by configuring these settings on the *<host>* or *<partner>* pages. You can also create these endpoints when you configure an outbound message flow:
