= Endpoints

Endpoints define the transport protocol configurations necessary to receive or send messages with external partners or internal backend applications.

Anypoint Partner Manager uses endpoints to:

* Receive messages from partners
* Receive messages from backend applications
* Define transport protocols
* Specify message or message acknowledgement destinations

== Endpoint Ownership

Depending on the endpoint type, you can assign the host, partner, or third-party connection as the endpoint owner to control the use of endpoints within inbound and outbound message flows.

When creating partner-facing endpoints directly from a partner or third-party connection, the ownership of the endpoint is automatically assigned to the entity from which the endpoint was created.

In a message flow, endpoint availability depends on the endpoint ownership:

* If an endpoint is owned by the host, any partner or third-party connection can select the endpoint.
* If an endpoint is owned by a specific partner or third-party connection, then that endpoint is available only to the partner or third-party connection to which the endpoint is assigned.

== Supported Endpoint Protocols

The configuration of Partner Manager endpoints depends on the endpoint type and protocol. The following table describes the endpoint types, along with their supported protocols and possible owners:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Endpoint Type | Protocol | Owner
| Source at Host | FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP | Host
| Target at Host | FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP | Host
| Receive from Partners | AS2 |Host
|  | FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP | Host, partner, third-party connection
| Send to Partners| AS2
| Partner, third-party connection
|  | FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP | Host, partner, third-party connection
|===

== Endpoint Runtime Services

Using dynamic configurations, Partner Manager deploys generic endpoint services that can receive data from or send data to different endpoint configurations. Endpoint configurations of all supported protocols can be reused across various message flows and partners.

Partner Managerâ€™s deployment orchestration service inspects the message flow and associated configuration objects and determines which endpoint services to deploy or update based on whether any new endpoint configurations are added, updated, or removed.

The number and type of endpoint services deployed to your runtime depend on the transport protocols used to exchange data with your partners and backend systems.

Each unique AS2, HTTP, and HTTPS receive endpoint configuration results in the deployment of its own runtime application. You can view the runtime application name corresponding to a given configuration in Partner Manager, from the endpoint details page.

The endpoints for the transport protocols are always managed within a single generic endpoint service for the protocol and direction. The following table shows the prefix for the endpoint services:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Protocol |Direction |Application Name Prefix
|AS2 |Receive |b2b-inbound-as2-
|AS2 |Send |b2b-outbound-as2-
|FTP | Receive | b2b-inbound-ftp-
|FTP | Send | b2b-outbound-ftp-
|HTTP or HTTPS |Receive |b2b-inbound-http-
|HTTP or HTTPS |Send |b2b-outbound-http-
|SFTP |Receive |b2b-inbound-sftp-
|SFTP |Send |b2b-outbound-sftp-
|===

If you deploy to CloudHub, you can assign static IP addresses to the endpoint applications that connect to external systems from Runtime Manager, if your organization or your partners require allowlisting IP addresses. You can share the xref:runtime-manager::managing-applications-on-cloudhub#static-ips[static IP] address assigned to your endpoint application with your partners for them to allowlist the IP address, allowing the application to connect with their server.
