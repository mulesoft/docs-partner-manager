There are three types of endpoints within AnyPoint Partner Manager.

From the Host side:

* To receive transmissions from your partners.

* Where you route messages from your partners to a target at your backend systems.

* Sources of messages from your backend system that you send to your partners.

From the Partner side:

* Where you send transmissions to your partners, including acknowledgments.
