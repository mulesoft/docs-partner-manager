= Setting Up the Partner Manager Environment

Setting up the Partner Manager environment involves either deploying Partner Manager to CloudHub or deploying Partner Manager on-premises. In addition, you must configure a payload storage API that provides Partner Manager with a standardized way to connect to your solution for storing transmission content.

Partner Manager uses certificates to establish secure connections with endpoints. You can use a CA-signed certificates or upload your own self-signed certificates.
