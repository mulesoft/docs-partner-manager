= Setting up the Partner Manager Environment

Setting up the Anypoint Partner Manager environment involves the following:

* Configuring Partner Manager deployment settings.
+
You can deploy Partner Manager to either CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric, and you can configure separate deployment settings for each business group environment. Configure Partner Manager deployment settings in access management, as described in xref:deploy-partner-manager.adoc[].
+
* Configuring a payload storage API.
+
You must configure a payload storage API that provides Partner Manager with a standardized way to connect to your solution for storing transmission content. For more information, see xref:setup-payload-storage-API.adoc[].
+
* Uploading your own, self-signed certificates, if you want to use them to establish secure connections with endpoints.  
+
You can use CA-signed certificates instead of your own self-signed certificates.
+
For more information, see xref:certificates.adoc[].
