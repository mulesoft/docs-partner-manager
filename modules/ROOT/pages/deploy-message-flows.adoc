= Deploying and Testing Message Flows

Anypoint Partner Manager dynamically validates the message flow configuration elements as you complete them and displays a green checkmark next to each of the validated elements.

After Partner Manager validates the message flow configuration elements, deploy and test the message flow in a sandbox environment. It can take up to five minutes from the time the message flow deployment completes in the UI for the changes to take effect in the runtime.

== Deploy Message Flows

In non-CloudHub environments, minimize the impact of the service interruption caused by deploying a message flow by deploying outside of your regular business hours. This issue does not exist on CloudHub because CloudHub provides a zero-downtime update of the AS2 endpoint application.

To deploy a message flow, click the *Deploy* button.

The message flow is deployed to Mule runtime engine, enabling you to:

* Start receiving messages from your partner
* Use the *Activity* page to track the processed messages

== Test a Deployed Message Flow

After you deploy the message flow, send test messages to verify that:

* You can receive messages and acknowledgements from your partners.
* The DataWeave map works.
* Your backend applications receive the transformed messages.

Test your message flow in your Partner Manager sandbox environment by sending a test file to the receiving endpoint:

. In the navigation menu, select *Activity* and the transmission to test.
. Scan for an exclamation point (!) in any of the boxes next to the displayed flow stages and address any issues.
. If the system is set up to view payloads, review the received payload by clicking *View payload* next to the *Received transmission* section.
+
If you're not sure about whether you should be able to view a payload, contact your B2B System Administrator.
. If TA1 and functional acknowledgements (999 or 997) are set, review and confirm that they are present.
. Verify that the transmission routed the messages to the correct message flow.
. Verify that Partner Manager routed the messages to the target system, delivered the messages to the target endpoint,
 and transformed the messages correctly.
