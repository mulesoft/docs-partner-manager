= Creating Outbound Message Flows

Create outbound message flows to receive messages from your backend applications, validate and transform these messages to the format your partners expect, and then send them to your partners either directly, or through third-party connections.

Before you create your first message flow, configure your xref:setup-payload-storage-API.adoc[payload storage API].

To create an outbound message flow:

. From the Anypoint Partner Manager navigation menu, select *Message Flows*.
. Click *New message flow > Send to partner*.
. Either select an existing partner or select *New* to create a new partner, as described in xref:create-partner.adoc#[Create a Partner].
. Configure the receiving endpoint.
. Configure the source message type.
. Configure reference IDs for the partner and host.
. Import the translation map.
. Configure the target message type.
. Configure the target endpoint.
. Verify that the message flow is complete.

[[source-at-host-endpoint]]
== Configure the Receiving Endpoint

The receiving endpoint (Source at Host endpoint) in an outbound message flow receives application messages from the backend applications. Partner Manager supports the FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SFTP formats for the receiving endpoint.

To configure the receiving endpoint:

. In the message flow, expand the *Source at <host-name>* section and click *Select*.
. In the *Select an endpoint: Source at <host-name>* window, do either of the following:
* Select an existing Source at Host endpoint and click *Select*.
* Click *New* to create a new Source at Host endpoint, as described in xref:create-endpoint.adoc[Creating Endpoints].

[[source-message-type]]
== Configure the Source Message Type

The source message type (Source at Host message type) in an outbound message flow defines the structure of the messages that Partner Manager receives from the backend applications. Partner Manager translates these messages to a configured Send to Partners message type, and then sends them to your partners, either directly or through a third-party connection.

Partner Manager supports the JSON and XML source message types in outbound message flows.

To create the source message type:

. In the message flow, expand the *Source message type* section and click *Select*.
. In the *Source message type* window, do either of the following:
* Select an existing Source at Host message type and click *Select*.
* Click *New* to create a new Source at Host message type, as described in xref:partner-manager-create-message-type.adoc[Creating Message Types].

[[reference-ids]]
== Configure Reference IDs for the Partner and Host

Partner Manager uses the partner reference ID and host reference ID to locate the appropriate message flow for routing outbound messages. For information about how this routing process works, see xref:partner-manager-identifiers.adoc[Sender and Receiver Identifiers] and xref:outbound-message-routing.adoc[Outbound Message Routing].

To configure a partner reference ID, either select *All available identifiers* or select a specific partner identifier.

To configure a host reference ID, either select *Ignore* or select your organization's internal reference ID (such as the business unit name) as it appears in the data element of the source JSON or XML message from your backend applications.

[[translation-map]]
== Import the Translation Map

A translation map in an outbound message flow transforms outbound messages from your organization's enterprise application format to the format your partners expect. Create a translation map by using DataWeave. For more information, see xref:partner-manager-maps.adoc[Translation Maps].

To import the translation map:

. In the message flow, expand the *Map* section.
. Click *Import > Choose file*.
. Navigate to the DataWeave map you want to use and click *Open*.
. Click *Upload mapping*.

After you import the translation map for an outbound message flow, you can add additional source message attributes to the map. This makes these attributes available in the message playoad. The attributes that you can add depend on the protocol of the source endpoint. For more information, see xref:access-source-message-attributes.adoc[Accessing Inbound Message Attributes]. 

[[send-to-partner-message-type]]
== Configure the Target Message Type

The target message type (Send to Partners message type) in an outbound message flow defines the structure of the messages that Partner Manager sends to the partner, either directly or via a third-party connection. Partner Manager supports the JSON, EDIFACT, X12, and XML formats for target message types.

For the EDIFACT and X12 message types, configuring the target message type also involves configuring acknowledgements (optional), creating custom EDIFACT settings (optional), and selecting EDIFACT identifiers to use for routing the outbound messages.

To configure the target message type:

. Expand the *Message type* section and click *Select*.
. In the *Select message type* window, do either of the following:
* Select an existing Send to Partners message type and click *Select*.
* Click *New* to create a new Send to Partners message type, as described in xref:partner-manager-create-message-type.adoc[Creating Message Types].
. Click *Save*.
+
The message type and its validation settings are added to the message flow.
. Optionally configure acknowledgement settings for the outbound message.
. Optionally apply custom validation settings delimiters and character encoding to the outbound message flow.
. In the *<protocol> Identifiers* section, select the sender and receiver identifiers to use on either the X12 ISA and GS segments or the EDIFACT UNB segments.
+
These identifiers are configured in the host and partner profiles.

=== Configure Acknowledgment Settings

To configure acknowledgement settings for the outbound messages that use the message flow:

. In the *Acknowledgement* section, select *Expect functional acknowledgement* (X12) or *Expect CONTRL functional acknowledgment* (EDIFACT).
. Do either of the following:
* Select an existing endpoint at which to receive your partner's acknowledgement transaction.
* Click *New* to create a new endpoint, as described in xref:create-endpoint.adoc[Creating Endpoints].
. In the *Mark overdue after* field, accept the default value of *24 Hours* or configure when you want the outbound transaction to be marked as overdue for an acknowledgement, according to the SLAs you have with your trading partner.

=== Optionally Apply Custom Validation Settings to EDIFACT and X12 Endpoints

By default, Partner Manager uses the EDIFACT or X12 send settings configured for the partner or third-party connection for message validation, delimiters, and character encoding.

To apply custom validation settings and delimiters to the outbound message flow, follow these steps:

. In the *EDIFACT Settings* section, select either *Custom X12 settings* or *Custom EDIFACT settings* and provide custom configuration values.
. In the *<protocol> Identifiers* section, select the sender and receiver identifiers to use on either the X12 ISA and GS segments or the EDIFACT UNB segments.
+
These identifiers are configured in the host and partner profiles.

[[send-to-partner-endpoint]]
== Configure the Target Endpoint

The Target endpoint (Send to Partners endpoint) is the target endpoint to which transformed messages are sent to partners, either directly or via third-party connections. Use a third-party-owned Send to Partners endpoint for partners that use a third-party connection.

Partner Manager supports the EDIFACT and X12 protocols for Send to Partners endpoints.

To configure the target endpoint:

. In the message flow, expand the *Send to <partner>* section and click *Select*.
. Do either of the following:
* Select an existing Send to Partners endpoint and click *Select*.
+
You can select any previously configured Send to Partners endpoints owned by the host, the partner for whom the message flow is configured, or a third-party connection.
+
* Click *New* to create a new Send to Partners endpoint, as described in xref:create-endpoint.adoc[Creating Endpoints].

If you selected AS2 as the protocol and there is no certificate associated with the partner or third-party profile, import the certificate of the partner or third-party connection that owns the endpoint.

== Verify That the Message Flow Is Complete

Partner Manager dynamically validates the message flow configuration elements as you complete them and displays a green checkmark next to each of the validated elements. After you verify the configurations, you are ready to deploy the message flow.
