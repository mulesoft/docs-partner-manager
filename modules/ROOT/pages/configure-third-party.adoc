= Configuring and Managing Third-Party Connections

If your trading partners use third-party service providers such as VANs or 3PLs (third-party logistics providers) who manage the B2B connectivity with your organization on behalf of your partners, you can create a third-party connection to manage configurations such as the endpoints, identifiers, and certificates of the third-party provider.

Use the *Partners* page to create and manage third-party connections. From this page, you can:

* xref:create-third-party.adoc[Create a new third-party connection]
* xref:partner-manager-identifiers.adoc[Add the AS2 identifiers] used by the third-party connection.
* Add digital xref:Certificates.adoc[certificates] associated with the third-party connection.
* xref:create-endpoint.adoc[Create] and manage source and target endpoints owned by the third-party connection.
* xref:modify-third-party-settings.adoc[Modify third-party connection settings]
* xref:delete-third-party.adoc[Delete a third-party connection]

After you create a third-party connection, you can select the endpoints and identifiers configured for that connection in message flows created for your partners.
