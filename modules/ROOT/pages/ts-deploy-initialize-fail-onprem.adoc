= Deployment Initialization failed (with On Premise Deployment target)

ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

== Causes

* You do not have the appropriate server group (or name for the server group) for the deployed message flow.

* Your runtime servers are either not set up or are not active.

== Solution

. In the deployment environment, log in to Anypoint Platform > *Runtime Manager*.

. Click *Servers* and verify that the server group `B2BServerGroup` is configured and in `Running` Status.

* If the server group is in a `Stopped` status contact your MuleSoft platform operations or administration team to review and restart the server.

* If you do not have this server group set up, refer to xref:deploy-onpremise.adoc[].
