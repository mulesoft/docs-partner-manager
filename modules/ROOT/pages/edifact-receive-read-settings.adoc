[[ack-settings]]
== Acknowledgment Settings

Optionally configure acknowledgment settings for each Inbound EDIFACT message flow. To configure acknowledgement settings:

*Vijay, please make sure these descriptions are correct. Is there a better way to distinguish them from each other in the decriptions?*

* Enable *Send CONTRL technical acknowledgement for each transmission from <partner-name>*.
+
This acknowledgement indicates whether Partner Manager received and accepted the message.
+
* Enable the *Send CONTRL functional acknowledgement when messages fail to route to a message flow* setting.
+
This acknowledgement indicates whether Partner Manager received and accepted the message when there is a routing failure.

If you enable one of these options, you must either select the partner endpoint to which to send the acknowledgements or create a new endpoint for this purpose.

Parter Manager logs all validation errors and reports them in the CONTRL acknowledgments.

[[control-numbers]]

Use these settings to apply validations related to your partner or to your use of control numbers within the EDIFACT message:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description |Default

|Require unique interchange control number
a| * If selected, Partner Manager records the interchange numbers previously processed and rejects duplicate interchange numbers from the same partner, as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification.
* If unselected, Partner Manager enables processing of the received interchange to continue.
|Disabled

|Require unique message control number
a| If selected, Partner Manager enforces globally unique message control numbers (UNH01) for received transaction sets.
