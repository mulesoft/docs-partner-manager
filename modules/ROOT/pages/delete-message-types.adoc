= Deleting Message Types

You can delete message types from the *<host>* page if they are not used in message flows:

. In the sidebar, select *<host-name>*.
. In the *Message type* section, locate the message type you want to delete.

To locate message types that don't have associated message flows, look for `-` in the *Message Flows* column.

. In the row containing the endpoint you want to delete, hover over the message type name, select the trash can that appears, and click *Delete*.
