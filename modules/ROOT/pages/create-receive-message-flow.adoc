When receiving a B2B message from your partner, your trading partner may send you more than one URL, a receiving URL and a URL for receiving asynchronous MDNs. If this is the case, you only need to configure the Receiving URL; if a separate URL is needed to return MDNs to, it will be sent in the AS2 transmission and Partner Manager will read it from there.

== To set up Receive from partner:

. Select Message Flows from the left-hand navigation. +
. Click the *New Message Flow* button and select Receive from partner from the drop-down menu. +
. Associate an existing partner that you created, or click the *New Partner button* to create one. +
. If you are creating one, fill in the receiving endpoint. +
. Select the Source message. +
. Import the Dataweave script for the Map file. +
. Select the Target document type. +
. Click the *Done* button when the setup is complete. +
. Click the *Deploy* to make the flow live. +
