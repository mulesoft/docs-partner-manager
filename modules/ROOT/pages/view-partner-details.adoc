= View a Partner's Details

After you create a new partner, you can view details for the partner:

. In Partner Manager, select *Partners* in the navigation menu to access the *Partners* page.
. Click the partner to view its details and to make the following updates.
+
* Add information about your partner along with contact details.
* Add partner endpoints (where you send and receive messages to and from your partners, including acknowledgment endpoints).
* Specify EDI message format preferences for your partner (such as X12), and any associated validations such as the need for acknowledgments (like TA1, 997, 999, and so on).
* Specify the message types to use.
+
For example, a purchase order in X12 is an 850 message. You also need to know the X12 version to use in your transactions (such as 004010, 005010, and so on).
* Add your partner's digital certificates (such as an X.509 certificate).
