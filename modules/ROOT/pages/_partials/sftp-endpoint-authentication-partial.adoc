SSH private key file. The following considerations apply:

* Send and receive endpoints that have the same owner can use the same SSH private key file. 
* Multiple message flows for the same or different partners can reference endpoints that use the same SSH private key file. 

You can either select a private key file (`.pem`) that's already configured in Anypoint Partner Manager or create a new configuration for a private key file.

To create a new configuration for a private key file:

. In the *<partner> SSH* or *<host> SSH* field, click *Select*.
. In the *Select a <partner> ssh* or *Select a <host> ssh* dialog, click *New*.
. Complete the fields in the *New certificate for <partner>* or *New certificate for <host>* dialog:
+
* *Identity Key name*
+
Enter the name of the private key file.
+
* *<partner> identity key PEM file* or *<host> identity key PEM file* 
+
Click *Choose file* to select the private key file.
+
* *Key passphrase*
+
Enter the passphrase for the private key file.
+
* *Expiration date*
+
Enter the date on which you want the private key file to expire. This date is a reminder for you, but Anypoint Partner Manager doesn't enforce it.
+
. Click *Create*.
