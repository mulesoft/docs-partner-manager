= Creating Partners

Create a new partner by using the *Partners* page to specify partner-specific information such as name, identifiers, endpoints, and validation rules.

Before you create your first partner, xref:setup-payload-storage-API.adoc[make sure that you have configured your payload storage API] and that you have the following information:

* The partner's name (usually the name of the company)
* One or more partner identifiers (such as the AS2 ID, X12-ISA, X12 GS, and so on)

To create a partner:

. In Partner Manager, select *Partners* in the sidebar.
. Click *Create partner > Partner*.
