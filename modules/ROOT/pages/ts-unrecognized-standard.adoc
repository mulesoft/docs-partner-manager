You might occasionally see tracking information such as this in the Activity section of Anypoint Partner Manager:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
Unrecognized standard from unrecognized partner
Received <date>
File <name>
----

== Cause

This situation occurs when Partner Manager receives a transmission in unsupported data format. For example, receiving a CSV, XML and so forth on receiving endpoints.

== Solution

If you encounter such a scenario, then verify with your partner that they are sending valid X12 format files.
