You might occasionally see tracking information such as this in the Activity section of Anypoint Partner Manager:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
Unrecognized standard from unrecognized partner
Received <date>
File <name>
----

== Causes

This information appears in the Activity section when one of the following occurs:

* Partner Manager receives a transmission that is in an unsupported data format: for example, receiving a PDF, image, and so forth on receiving endpoints.

* Your partner sends you a valid X12 file but you have not configured a message flow that can accept it.

* You do not recognize the partner because you did not set them up in Anypoint Partner Manager.

== Solution

If you encounter any of these situations, verify that your partner is sending valid X12-formatted files that align with the message flows that you associated with that partner.
