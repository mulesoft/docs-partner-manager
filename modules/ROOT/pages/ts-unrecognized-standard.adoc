You might occasionally see tracking information such as this in the Activity section of Anypoint Partner Manager:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
Unrecognized standard from unrecognized partner
Received <date>
File <name>
----

== Cause

This information appears when:
* Partner Manager receives a transmission in an unsupported data format. For example, receiving a PDF, image, and so forth on receiving endpoints.
* Your trading partner sends you a valid X12 file for which you have not configured a message flow that can handle it.
* You do not recognize the trading partner i.e. they are not setup by you in Anypoint Partner Manager.

== Solution

If you encounter such a scenario, then verify with your partner that they are sending valid X12 format files, that aligns with the message flows you have created associated to the trading partner.
