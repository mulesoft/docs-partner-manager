= Delete Identifiers

You can delete identifiers such as X12 ISA, X12 GS, AS2, and DUNS.

Although you must always have at least one identifier per message flow, you can delete identifiers that are no longer used in that message flow.

Before you delete an identifier, consider the following:

* You cannot delete an identifier that is used in a message flow.
* Deleting an existing host or partner identifier impacts the identification and routing of B2B messages to the associated partner.
* If you need to replace the identifier with another identifier, record the required values and qualifier type.

== Steps
. In the left navigation menu, select *Partners*.
. Select the partner containing the identifier you want to delete.
. In the *Identifiers* row, hover over the identifier you want to delete and click the trash can icon.
