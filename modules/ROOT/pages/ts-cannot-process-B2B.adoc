= Cannot process B2B transactions successfully

ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

You discover that transactions are not being processed when you test the message flow or when your partner sends you B2B messages.

== Causes

Any of the following can lead to this type of error:

* Your payload storage is not set up correctly or is not functioning properly.

If the payload storage is not functional, B2B messages are not processed.

* The message flow configuration is not aligned with the message being received from the partner.

Examples of incorrect message flow configuration include incorrect or missing identifiers, incorrect message types, and so forth.

* The Mule servers that process your B2B integration workloads are not functioning properly.

For example, your servers can be inactive, the apps might not be functioning correctly, and so forth.

== Solutions

You'll need to perform some verifications with your payload storage or flow configurations.

=== Verify Payload Storage

Verify the appropriate configuration for the payload storage API.

If the payload storage app is functioning, verify that the storage source (the S3 bucket, or Azure Blob store, or database, and so on)
that you are using as the storage solution is up and functioning.

* Open Anypoint Runtime Manager to verify if the related payload storage app is active.
* Try restarting the app.
* Test your payload storage API configuration using a browser extension such as Postman on Google Chrome.

=== Verify Flow Configurations

Verify that your message flow configuration is compatible with that of your partner.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment (either Sandbox or Production), select your <Hostname> profile.

. Select *Message Flows*.

. Search for your message flow by the partner name or the message type such as 850.

. After you locate the message flow, click on the message flow card to open it up.

. From the message flow configurator, verify that the following information is in accordance with your agreement with your partner:

** The correct identifiers are associated with the partner.

** The appropriate receive endpoint is configured in the flow.

** The appropriate document type (such as X12, version - 4010, or message type - 850) is configured.

** Verify that you have the appropriate acknowledgement configuration.

** Verify that you have an appropriate DataWeave map in the transformation section.

** Verify that you have configured an appropriate target, such as both the message type of the target and the associated endpoint configuration.

. If all of these look good, then ensure that the last deployment for this flow was successful by viewing the latest deployment history next to the flow.

. If you observe a Failed status, try to deploy the message flow to ensure all your configurations have persisted on the Mule apps.

NOTE: It can take up to five minutes for your most recent changes to be effective on the runtime B2B Mule apps.

=== Verify B2B Integration Apps

Verify that your B2B integration apps are active.

. From Anypoint Platform, select Anypoint Runtime Manager and *Applications*.

. Verify that the B2B apps on Mule are active by looking for a status of `started`. The list of apps includes:

* APIReplicationService

* DocumentProcessingService

* One or more inbound apps.

The names of these apps are prefaced with inbound-

* One or more outbound apps.

The names of these apps are prefaced with outbound-

* Possibly one or more acknowledgement apps.

The names of these apps are prefaced with ack-


For any of the B2B integration apps that do not have a started status:

. From Anypoint Platform, select Anypoint Runtime Manager and *Applications*.

. For each app that does not have started status, select its row in the table and select *Restart* from the drop-down menu in the upper right of the status area in the information panel.

. If restarting the app does not help you recover the application, select its row in the table and select *Delete* from the drop-down menu in the upper right of the status area in the information panel and confirm the deletion.

. Navigate back to the message flow related to the app you just deleted and deploy the message flow.

Consider the following when performing a delete:

** If you delete the `DocumentProcessingService` or the `APIReplicationService`, deploying any flow results in the redeployment of those apps.

** If you delete any of the inbound, outbound, or ack apps, you must redeploy the specific flow corresponding to the deleted apps.

If you can't access the Support Portal, contact your Customer Success Manager or MuleSoft Account Management team for help.
