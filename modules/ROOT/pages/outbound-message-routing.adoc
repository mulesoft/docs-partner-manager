= Outbound Message Routing

Partner Manager’s outbound message processing framework provides the flexibility to implement receive endpoints in a variety of ways.

You can:

* Use a single endpoint to receive different types of application messages, such as advance shipment notices and invoices, from your backend systems.
* Use dedicated endpoints for each message type from backend systems.
* Follow a balanced approach by implementing a mixed set of receive endpoints to receive application messages from backend systems.

When messages are received by the endpoint, Partner Manager routes the payload to the appropriate message flow based on the message type, partner reference identifier, and host reference ID configurations:

* Partner Manager Identifies the message type:
** Relative path for HTTP(s) endpoints
** File name for SFTP
* The payload is validated against the schema supplied during the message type definition.
* Partner Manager leverages the DataWeave map supplied during the source at host message type definition to extract the partner reference ID, host reference ID, and business key.
* The partner reference identifier and host reference identifier (optional) are used to resolve the message flow through which the transaction must be processed as shown in the following diagram:
