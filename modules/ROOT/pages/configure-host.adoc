Your organization or https://docs.mulesoft.com/access-management/business-groups[Anypoint busines group] is considered the host partner in Anypoint Partner Manager.
Within the host page you can do the following:

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify yourself.

* Add certificates owned by your organization.

* Configure validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings applicable to all message flows, across all trading partners. This is a truly global configuration which you can reuse in all message flows across your trading partners.

* Add a storage mechanism to store your B2B message payloads.


== Update the host's profile

Open Anypoint Partner Manager and select the name of your organization from the navigation pane on the left-hand side. From here you configure the following based on your indentifier and certificate type. This includes any global settings you need to modify, and the location of your payload storage configuration.

. Add an identifier related to your organization. To add an identifier, click the `New` button within the `Identifiers` section. Select an identifier type from the `Type` drop-down menu. This uniquely identifies your identity. For example, depending on your setup, select one of the following: AS2, X12 ISA, X12 GS, or the DUNS number. Proceed to provide a value for your identifier and click on the `Create Identifier` button when done.

. Upload any digital certificates (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol). To upload a certificate, click the `New` button within the `Certificates` section. This is your digital certificate (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol). Upload the digital certificate (typically a .PEM file) provided by clicking the `Upload certificate` button. When a certificate is successfully uploaded you receive a confirmation message.

. Change any of the default global X12 validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings.

Global X12 setting include:

* Validations
* Control numbers
* Character sets

Refer to the following options for each here.
