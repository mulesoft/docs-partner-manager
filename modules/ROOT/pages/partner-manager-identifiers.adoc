= Sender and Receiver Identifiers

AS2, EDIFACT, and X12 transactions use identifiers in messages to identify the senders and receivers of the messages. For X12 messages, the identifiers in the ISA and GS headers provide valuable information that enables identification of the appropriate flow to use to process the transaction.

Add identifiers and configure their values in the Partner Manager host page.

[[create-identifier]]
== Add and Configure a New Identifier

. In Partner Manager, select the name of your host organization in the navigation menu.
. In the *Identifiers* section, click *New*.
. In the *New Identifier* dialog, select the identifier type from the drop-down list:
* <<as2-identifier,AS2 Identity>>
* <<edifact-unb, EDIFACT-UNB>>
* <<reference-id,Reference ID>>
* <<x12-gs,X12 - GS>>
* <<x12-isa,X12 - ISA>>
. In *Identifier Value*, enter a value to uniquely name your identifier.
. If you selected *EDIFACT-UNB* or *X12-ISA* as the *Type* value, you must also select a *Qualifier* from the list.
. Click *Create identifier*.

[[edifact-unb]]
== EDIFACT UNB Identifier Values

Use the following values to configure the EDIFACT UNB identifier type:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description | Required

|Qualifier
|
Select the qualifier types for the partner’s EDIFACT UNB identifier from the drop-down menu.
|Yes
| Identifier value
| Specify the EDIFACT-UNB ID for your partner, which can be up to 15 characters. Your partner supplies you with the proper EDIFACT Interchange Sender and Receiver IDs during onboarding.
| Yes

|===

[[as2-identifier]]
== AS2 Identifier Values

To use AS2 transport to exchange B2B transactions with your partner, first configure the AS2 identifier for your organization and for your partner.

Use the following values to configure the AS2 identifier:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description | Required
|Identifier value
|The AS2 identity for your partner. Your partner supplies you with the corresponding Sender and Receiver AS2 IDs during the onboarding process.
|Yes
|===

[[x12-isa]]
== X12 ISA Identifier Values

Use the following values to configure the X12 ISA identifier type:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description | Required

|Qualifier
a| Select the qualifier type for the partner’s X12-ISA identifier from the drop-down menu.
|Yes
|Identifier value
|EDI X12-ISA ID for your partner, which can be up to 15 characters. Your partner supplies you with the proper EDI X12 Interchange Sender and Receiver IDs during onboarding.
|Yes
|===

[[x12-gs]]
== X12 GS Identifier Values

Use the following values to configure the X12 GS identifier type:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description | Required

|Identifier value
|EDI X12-GS ID for your partner, which can be up to 15 characters. Your partner supplies you with the proper EDI X12 Group Sender and Receiver IDs during onboarding.
|Yes
|===

[[reference-id]]
== Outbound Message Flow Partner Reference Identifiers

Outbound message flows that transform your back-end application messages to EDI format use the partner Reference ID when sending data to your partners.

Unlike EDI transactions that have well-defined standards for how sender, receiver, and document type information is presented in the data, the source messages for outbound B2B data exchange originating from your enterprise back-end systems typically follow schemas. These schemas are usually defined by your back-end application teams according to your organization’s data models.

The receiving partner information about the application message from the back-end application might not necessarily be the same as the name of the partner in Partner Manager. This scenario is similar to how ISA and GS identifiers on an inbound EDI message might not be the same as the profile name of the partner.

The Partner Manager outbound message processing framework makes a dynamic lookup to determine the receiving partner based on the content in the application message received from the backend systems.

=== Example

In this example, an outbound purchase order XML message from your ERP system to your partner, Mythical Supplier, has the following content in the payload:

`<VendorName>MYTHICAL SUPPLIER, LLC</VendorName>`

An outbound payment remittance advice JSON message from your Financials system to the same partner contains the following content in the payload:

`"PayeeName": "MYTHICAL ENTERPRISES"`

For Partner Manager to route these outbound transactions to the appropriate message flows for Mythical Supplier, you must add these values as Partner Reference IDs from the partner’s profile page. To do this <<create-identifier,create a new identifier>> and select the type as *Reference ID*.

If your back-end application sends outbound transactions to partners on behalf of more than one internal line of business, thus requiring you to set different X12 ISA and X12 GS sender identifiers on the transformed outbound data (depending on which line of business is sending the transaction), you can configure partner reference identifiers on your host profile, with the value in the application message’s payload that uniquely identifies the sending LoB.

The actual usage of partner reference identifiers and how outbound message routing is determined, is explained in the outbound message documentation.
