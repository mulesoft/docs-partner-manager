= Configuring Global EDIFACT Receive Settings

When EDIFACT messages received from your partners do not contain a UNA segment, Partner Manager uses the delimiters specified in the *Global EDIFACT settings: Receive from partners* window to parse the received EDIFACT payloads. These settings are defined under the host organizationâ€™s profile:

[%header%autowidth.spread]

| Data element separator | Data element separator character | +
|Component separator | Component element separator character | :
|Repetition separator | Repetition separator character | *
| Segment terminator | Segment terminator character | '
| Release character | Release character | ?
