= AS2 Send Endpoint Settings

AS2 send endpoint settings determine where to send B2B messages transmitted over AS2.

An AS2 Send to Partners endpoint (the only type of AS2 send endpoint) can act as:

* A target endpoint in an outbound message flow through which transformed B2B messages are sent to partners, either directly or via third-party connections
* An acknowledgment endpoint in an inbound message flow

Either a partner or a third-party connection can own AS2 send endpoints.

Create AS2 endpoints by configuring these settings on the partner or third-party connection pages:

|===
|Setting |Description |Required

|Owner
|Partner or third-party connection that owns the endpoint.
|x

|Usage
|`Send to partners`
|

|Protocol
|Protocol that the endpoint supports.
|x

|Endpoint name
|Automatically generated name used to identify the endpoint, which you can subsequently modify manually.
|x

|Description
|User-supplied value that describes the purpose of the endpoint.
|

|<Host> AS2 identifier
|Your organization’s AS2 identifier.
|x

|Partner AS2 identifier
|Your partner’s AS2 identifier, which appears if the endpoint is used to send transactions directly to a partner without going through a third-party connection.
|x

|<VAN> AS2 identifier
|Your VAN’s AS2 identifier, which appears if the endpoint is used to send transactions to a third-party connection. 
|x

|Partner AS2 URL
|Your partner’s or third-party connection's AS2 URL to which outbound EDI transmissions are sent.
|x

|Certificate
a|
* Use CA-signed certificates
* Use a self-signed certificate
* Allow insecure connection
|x

|Authentication type
a|Authentication type used to access the endpoint. Allowed values:

* None
+
Does not require backend applications to authenticate when connecting to this endpoint.
+
* Basic
+
Requires backend applications to use the username and password provided by your partner to connect to this endpoint.
Enter this information in the *Username* and *Password* fields.
|x

|Connection timeout
|Timeout for establishing a connection to the remote service. The default is `30 Seconds`.
|x

|Retry interval
|Frequency of reconnection attempts when unable to connect to the remote AS2 service. The default is `30 Seconds`.
|x

|Maximum retry attempts
|Maximum number of reconnection attempts to make. If you don't want Partner Manager to retry after an initial connection failure, set this value to `0`.
|x

|Respond to email address
|Email address to use as the HTTP 'From' header when sending.
|x

|Message subject
|User-defined field for the MIME Subject header.
|x

|Filename pattern
|Filename pattern required by your partner.
|x

|<Host> keystore
a|Host keystore file that stores your organization's public certificate and private key. To create a new keystore when creating an endpoint:

--
. Click *New*.
. Complete the fields on the *New keystore for <host> window*.
. Click *Upload Keystore*.
--

|Encryption algorithm
| Algorithm to use to encrypt AS2 messages.
|x

|Signature algorithm
| Algorithm to use to compute the digital signature.
|x

|Request receipt
|
|x

|MDN response
|Message Disposition Notification (MDN). Is this always SYNC??? 
|x

|MDN signature algorithm
| Algorithm to use to compute the MDN signature.
|x

|x

|Encryption algorithm
|xref:as2-endpoints-algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] to use when encrypting the message to send.
|x

|Signature algorithm
|xref:as2-endpoints-algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] to use when setting the message-integrity check value.
|x

|Request receipt
a|Whether you want the partner to return a Message Disposition Notification (MDN) receipt.
|x

|MDN response
|The AS2 messages sent from Partner Manager always request the receiver to send a Synchronous MDN receipt back. The default is `Sync`.
|x

|MDN signature algorithm
|Request for a partner to respond with a signed Message Disposition Notification (MDN) using this xref:as2-endpoints-algorithms.adoc[algorithm] for calculating MIC.
|x
