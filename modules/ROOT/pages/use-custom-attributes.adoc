= Using Custom Message Attributes with Message Types

You can associate up to five custom message attributes with a Receive from Partners or Source at Host message type. Using these attributes enables you to have visibility into the full lifecycle of your B2B workflow.

For example, you can define attributes for a message's PO number, Sales order number, Invoice number, and Shipment ID. When you associate these attributes with a message type in a message flow, Partner Manager extracts this data from the inbound or outbound payload and displays it in the message view of the *Activity* window. From there, you can search for an attribute value, such as a specific PO Number, so you can view every message that has the specified attribute value.

== Create a Custom Message Attribute

Use the *<host>* page to create new custom message attributes:

. In the sidebar, select *<host>*.
. From the *Custom message attributes* section, click *New*.
. Enter the attribute alias and label.
+
The alias is used in the reference map that is associated with the message type. The label is used in the message view of the transactions. Both the alias and the label must be unique across the host.
+
. To make the attribute searchable on the *Activity* window, select the *Is searchable* checkbox.
+
. Repeat these steps for each new attribute you want to define.
. Click *Save*.

== Associate a Custom Message Attribute with a Message Type

To associate a custom message attribute with a message type, include definitions for those attributes in the message type's reference map. For more information, see xref:create-reference-map.adoc[Creating Reference Maps for Message Types].

To dissociate a custom message attribute from a message type, remove it from the message type's reference map.

You can delete custom attributes that are not used in reference maps:

. In the sidebar, select the *<host-name>*.
. In the *Custom message attributes* section, locate the attribute you want to delete.
