The only information you need to create a new trading partner is the name and a single identifier related to that partner.
You can add other information later.
Once created, each partner has its own page and shows up in the 'Partners' tab in the left navigation menu.

From the Partners page you can:

* Add information about your trading partners along with contact details.

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify them from one another.

* Add certificates owned by your trading partner.

* Configure validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings applicable to all message flows for this trading partner.

== Create a Trading Partner

. Open Anypoint Partner Manager.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment, select `Partners` from the left navigation.

. Click the *New Partner* button.

. Add your trading partner's name.

. Select an Identifier from the `Type` drop-down menu. This uniquely identifies you as a trading partner. For example, depending on your setup, select one of the following: AS2, X12 ISA, X12 GS, or the DUNS number.

. Click the *Create Partner* button to create your trading partner. At this point, your trading partner has been created within the Anypoint platform, so you can go to setup message flows related to this partner.

== Update a Trading Partner's Profile

You can also add more details related to a trading partner's profile. You can add the following information for each trading partner from the `Partners` selection in the left navigation:

. Click the *About* button.

. Add the following by clicking the *Edit* button under the `About` section:

** Description - Provide a brief description about your partners business, what kind of trading relationship your organization has with the trading partner, and so on.

. Add more identifiers for your trading partner by clicking the *New* button within the `Identifiers` section. Select an appropriate identifier type and add an identifier value as provided by your trading partner. 

. Click the *Create identifier* button to save your changes. When an identifier is successfully created you receive a confirmation message.

. To add a certificate, click the *New* button within the `Certificates` section. This is your partner's digital certificate (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol). 

. Upload the digital certificate (typically a .PEM file) provided by your trading partner by clicking the *Upload certificate* button. When a certificate is successfully uploaded you receive a confirmation message.
