This tutorial:

* Illustrates the role Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) plays in B2B transaction processing.
* Introduces _Transaction Designer_, an APM feature that enables you to design the elements of a transaction from beginning to end.
* Provides instructions for using Transaction Designer to configure APM so that you can simulate a transaction and see how APM processes it.

[[img-td-overview]]

image::td-overview.png[title="Transaction Overview"]

The elements required to process a transaction are shown in <<img-td-overview>>. In this tutorial, you will create and configure these elements in this order:

* <<Configure a Supplier>>
* <<Design a Target Channel>>
* <<Configure a Buyer>>
* <<Design a Source Channel>>
* <<Configure an S3 Bucket (optional)>>
* <<Copy APM Information>>
* <<Configure APM Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio>>
* <<Start the Applications>>
* <<Send a Message>>
* <<Monitor the Transaction>>


== Before You Begin

== Configure a Supplier

This tutorial works with two partners: a Supplier and a Buyer.

The Supplier is *AAZFasteners*, a fictional retailer of nuts and bolts, also identified on the <<img-partner-configuration>> as *YOUR COMPANY*.

NOTE: In your copy of APM, *YOUR COMPANY* is probably not named *AAZFasteners*. However, for illustration purposes, we refer to *YOUR COMPANY* as *AAZFasteners* throughout this tutorial. If you want to change the name of *YOUR COMPANY* to *AAZFasteners*, see xref:partner-configuration.adoc#create-and-configure-partners[Create and Configure Partners]. However, the tutorial will work without making this change.

The other partner in this tutorial is the _Buyer_, a fictional retailer of home supplies. In <<Create the Buyer Partner>>, we create this partner, identifying it as *AcmeHomeSupply*.
In the tutorial, AcmeHomeSupply uses APM to order products from AAZFasteners. In the following sections, you will:

* <<Add Identifiers>>

* <<Upload Certificates>>

=== Add Identifiers

_Identifiers_ are values, communicated in messages, that can be used to uniquely identify a specific partner. Some identifiers are defined by standards bodies, such as _DUNS numbers_, which are assigned by Dun and Bradstreet. Others are mutually defined between partners. AS2 uses identifiers to identify the sender and receiver of a transmission. X12 and EDIFACT use identifiers to identify the sender and receiver of an EDI document.

For these partners, we use two identifiers:

* X12-ISA
* AS2

In the following sections, we add identifiers for the supplier. We will add buyer identifiers in <<Add Buyer Identifiers>>.

==== Add Supplier X12-ISA Identifier

include::partial$tutorial/supplier/identifier-x12-isa-supplier.adoc[]

==== Add Supplier AS2 Identifier

include::partial$tutorial/supplier/identifier-as2-supplier.adoc[]

=== Upload Certificates

APM provides for the uploading of certificates to verify the identity of a partner.

==== Upload the Supplier Certificate

include::partial$tutorial/supplier/certificate-supplier.adoc[]


== Design a Target Channel

A _channel_ provides a means of specifying, for a given partner:

Type:: Source or Target, As created in xref:maps.adoc[Channels] or in xref:transaction-designer.adoc[Transaction Designer]. Source Channel settings are always specific to the origin of a document. Target Channel settings are always specific to the destination.
Document:: As created in xref:document-types.adoc[Document Types] or in xref:transaction-designer.adoc[Transaction Designer]
Document Map:: As created in xref:maps.adoc[Maps] or in xref:transaction-designer.adoc[Transaction Designer]
Endpoint:: As created in xref:endpoints.adoc[Endpoints] or in xref:transaction-designer.adoc[Transaction Designer]

In this section, you create a template for any transaction in which you receive a purchase order from a partner and send it to your HTTP endpoint. Later, in <<Design a Source Channel>>, you will use this template as the starting point from which you configure a transaction specific to receiving a purchase order from AcmeHomeSupply.

=== Start Transaction Designer

include::partial$tutorial/supplier/start-td-aaz.adoc[]

=== Create the Target Channel

include::partial$tutorial/supplier/td-target-channel-aaz.adoc[]


=== Create the Source Document Type for the Target Channel

The terms  _document_, _file_, and _message_ are used interchangeably in the B2B world to reflect an instance of a structured payload being passed through a system to convey information about a transaction. For consistency, we use the term document to represent these instances.

APM enables you to categorize and configure specific _Document Types_. In this section, you create a Source Document Type for the Target Channel.

==== To Create the Source Document Type for the Target Channel

include::partial$tutorial/supplier/td-target-channel-source-doc-aaz.adoc[]


=== Configure Endpoints

An _endpoint_ is the entry point to a service, a process, or a queue or topic destination in service-oriented architecture.
In APM, an endpoint defines the protocol, address, and other details specific to an exchange of messages between partners.

==== Configure the Target Endpoint

== Configure an S3 Bucket (optional)

Configuring an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket enables you to view message payloads in <<Monitor the Transaction>>. You will add configuration data from the bucket in <<Configure APM Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio>>.


== Copy APM Information

In order to identify your APM environment and its API Key to Anypoint Studio:

* <<Copy your Environment ID>>
* <<Identify or Create an API Key>>

=== Copy your Environment ID

. On the xref:anypoint-partner-manager.adoc#img-apm-start[B2B Transactions Page], in the left-hand navigation pane, click *Administration*, then click *Environments*.
. In the row that corresponds to the environment with which you are working, click *copy*.

=== Identify or Create an API Key

In order to create a Mule project, you must enter an xref:glossary.adoc#secta[API Key] and an .

If you have an existing API Key, use it. If you do not know the API Key, consult your organization's MuleSoft administrator.

If your organization has not created an API Key, you can use APM to create one.

WARNING: The API Key is used by every Mule application across your entire Master xref:access-management::organization.adoc[Organization] that communicates with Anypoint Partner Manager. Therefore, before you create a new API Key, coordinate with your organization's MuleSoft administrator to ensure that none of your organization's processes are using an existing API Key because, if they are, creating a new API Key will cause them to cease functioning. In that case, instead of creating a new API Key, use the existing API Key.

To obtain a key, see xref:administration.adoc#create-a-new-api-key[Create a New API Key].


== Configure APM Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio
