= Certificate and Keystore Storage

Certificates and keystores in Anypoint Partner Manager are securely stored in the Anypoint Platform secrets manager, which uses secure vault technology to store and control access to private keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets.

For endpoints that use certificates, you can either select an available certificate that works with the endpoint type and protocol or upload a new one to Partner Manager.
