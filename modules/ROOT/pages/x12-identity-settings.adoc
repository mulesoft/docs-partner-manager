== Delete Identifiers

You might want to delete an identifier when it is no longer needed.
Deleting an existing host or partner identifier impacts the identification and routing of B2B messages to the associated partner. Remember that there must always be at least one identifier per message flow.

Ask yourself the following when deleting an identifier: Why do you want to delete it? Do you need to replace it with another identifier?

After successfully deleting an identifier, you can create a new identifier with the same value as the one you deleted. If you need to replace the identifier you are deleting, record the values and qualifier type needed.

. In the sidebar, select *Partners*.

. In the *Identifiers* section, hover over the identifier that you want to delete and click the trash can icon that appears in the right-hand side of the row.

. If you need a replacement identifier, you can add it now by clicking *New*.
