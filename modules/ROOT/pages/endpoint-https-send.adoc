= HTTP and HTTPS Send Endpoint Settings

HTTP and HTTPS send endpoint settings configure where to send B2B messages transmitted over HTTP or HTTPS, respectively. There are two types of HTTP and HTTPS send endpoints:

* Send to Partners
** Target endpoint in an outbound message flow through which transformed B2B messages are sent to the partners either directly or via a third-party connection
** Acknowledgement endpoint in an inbound message flow

+
A host, partner, or third-party connection can own HTTP and HTTPS Send to Partners endpoints.
+
* Target at Host
+
Target endpoint in an inbound message flow through which transformed messages are sent to the backend applications.
+
Only a host can own HTTP and HTTPS Target at Host endpoints.

Create HTTP and HTTPS send endpoints by configuring these settings on the host, partner, or third-party connection page. You can also create these endpoints when you configure an outbound message flow.
