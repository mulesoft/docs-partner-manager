= Deleting Third-Party Connections

If you are no longer using a third-party connection, you can delete it from Anypoint Partner Manager. However, you cannot delete third-party connections if you have configured or deployed message flows for your partners that reference the third-party identifier or endpoints.

When you delete a third-party connection, it is removed from the *Partners* page. Also, all of the connection's data is deleted, except for information about connection-related activities that occurred before the deletion.

To delete a third-party connection:

. In Partner Manager, select *Partners* in the sidebar.
. Select the third-party connection to delete and click *Delete*.
. Confirm the deletion.

After you delete a third-party connection, you can reuse the connection name.
