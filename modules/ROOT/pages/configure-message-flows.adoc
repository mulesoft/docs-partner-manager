= Create and Configure a Message Flow
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

You can create and configure a message flow either when you create a trading partner or afterward. After you deploy the message flow, it's best to test it.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment (either Sandbox or Production), click *New message flows* in the upper right.

. Select an Existing Partner. You can do this from the *Select a partner* dialog, by searching for a partner by name.

. Once you find a match, choose the partner name and click *Select*. Clicking each section of the message flow expands it. A green checkmark next to any a section indicates that it is complete.

* Alternatively from the *Select a partner* dialog, you can create a new partner by clicking *New*.
This is the same as xref:configure-partner.adoc#create-a-trading-partner[Create a Trading Partner] except that when you are finished, you'll click *Create Partner and Message Flow*.
You can add more information to the partner later.
+
. Click *Select* from the *Receiving endpoint* section to configure the source endpoint where you receive the transmission.

. Click *Select* to search and select an existing endpoint or click *New* to create a new endpoint.

. To create a new endpoint, depending on the protocol, refer to the following:
+
* xref:endpoint-as2-receive.adoc[AS2 Endpoint Settings]

* xref:endpoint-sftp-receive-target.adoc[SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings]

+
. In the *Source message* section, click *Select* to expand the Message Type section.

. Either search and click *Select* to choose a previously used message type, or click *New* to create a new message type.

. For a new message type, depending on the message standard, refer to the following:
+
* xref:document-types.adoc[X12 and JSON Message Types]
+
. To optionally edit the validation settings, click *View* and the hostname.
For more information, see xref:x12-receive-read-settings.adoc[X12 Settings - Receive from Partner].
+
NOTE: It may take five minutes or so for your configuration changes to sync with Mule runtime.
+
. For X12 partner requirements, optionally configure the type of functional acknowledgment and the endpoint to which you send it.
+
* xref:endpoint-https-send.adoc[HTTP and HTTPS Send Configuration]

* xref:endpoint-sftp-receive-target.adoc[SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings]
+
. Click the *Map* section and then click *Import* to choose a DataWeave map.

. Select a map and click *Upload mapping*.

. Click the *Target at <Partner name>* section and click *Select* to set up a target message type.
This is the target message type and the Endpoint where you want to route the transformed message.

. Either search and select an existing message type, or create a new message type. To create a new message type, depending on the message standard, follow instructions in one of these sections.

+
* xref:document-types.adoc[X12 and JSON Message Types]
+
.  Click *Select* to set up a target endpoint.
. Either search for and select an existing endpoint, or create a new endpoint by clicking *New*.
+
* To create a new endpoint, depending on the protocol, refer to the following:

* xref:endpoint-sftp-receive-target.adoc[SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings]

* xref:endpoint-https-send.adoc[HTTP and HTTPS Send Configuration]

. After you create the source, map, and target sections in the interface, confirm that each shows a green check mark next to it in the flow, and click *Deploy* to deploy the configurations to Mule.
+
Your message flow configuration is deployed to your Mule runtime engine and you can start receiving messages from your partner.
+
. After a message flow is successfully deployed, you can track its processed messages using the Activity page.

== Test Message Flows

You should send test messages through the message flow after you deploy to verify the following:

* You are receiving messages and acknowledgments from your partners.

* Make sure that the DataWeave map is working and your backend systems receive the transformed message.

You test the flow by deploying it in a sandbox environment. When you verify that the flow is successful, you then undeploy it from the sandbox and deploy it to your production environment.

Test your message flow in your (sandbox or production) environment:

. Initiate a transmission on the receiving endpoint.

. From within Anypoint Partner Manager, select *Activity* and select the transmission from the list.

. Scan for an exclamation point (!) in any of the boxes next to the displayed flow stages, indicating an issue with the transmission and address them.

. If the system was set up to view payloads, you can review the received payload by clicking *View payload* next to the Received transmission section. If you are unsure about whether you should be able to view a payload, contact your B2B System Administrator.

. If you have TA1 and functional acknowledgments (999 or 997) set, review and confirm that they are there.

. Verify that the transmission routed messages to the correct message flows.

. Verify that the messages are routed to the target system:

** Successfully delivered to the target endpoint

** Transformed correctly
