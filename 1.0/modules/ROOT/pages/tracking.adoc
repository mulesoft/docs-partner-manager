Contact your MuleSoft representative for more information on MuleSoft's B2B solutions.

For a given message, Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) facilitates storage of:

Payload:: The content of the message

Metadata:: Data about the message

The xref:b2b-transaction-processing-framework.adoc#partner-manager-connector[Partner Manager Connector] posts:

* Metadata from
xref:b2b-transaction-processing-framework.adoc#customer-built-flows[Customer-Built Flows]
to the xref:b2b-transaction-processing-framework.adoc#tracking-api[Tracking API]
* Payload data within
xref:b2b-transaction-processing-framework.adoc#customer-built-flows[Customer-Built Flows]
 to Tracking Data Storage.

The customer then uses xref:anypoint-partner-manager.adoc[Anypoint Partner Manager] to request and view metadata and payload data, a process which includes the xref:b2b-transaction-processing-framework.adoc#trading-partner-management-api[Trading Partner Management API] and Tracking Data Storage. <<img-tracking-storage-and-retrieval>> illustrates this process

== Payload Tracking

APM payload tracking is designed to allow extensive customer control. You decide the following:

* Where payloads are stored
* For how long payloads are stored
* Who has access to payloads

=== Metadata Tracking

Metadata tracking is used for searching and viewing. Customers define properties to track, such as:

* Date and time
* Sender
* Recipient
* Payload URL - This URL points to the message payload and is part of metadata tracking; the message payload itself is part of <<Payload Tracking>>.

== Tracking Data Storage

You can store tracking data in either of two ways.

=== Amazon S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable cloud storage. Using this method, you need only create an account and configure account credentials in APM.

=== Customer-Selected Storage

This method enables a customer to store its message data at a location of its choice. For example, data can be stored in an on-premises database.
